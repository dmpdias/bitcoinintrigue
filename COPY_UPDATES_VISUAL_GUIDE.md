### 3️⃣ ABOUT PAGE - THE BIGGER PICTURE

#### BEFORE
```
Most Bitcoin content is written for
people who are already obsessed with
Bitcoin. Traders. Developers. People who
have a "portfolio." We write for
everyone else — the curious, the
cautious, and the people who just want
to know what they bought.
```

#### AFTER
```
We believe Bitcoin shouldn't be a casino.
It's a technology, a currency, and a
global shift. We're here to explain it
without the noise.
```

❌ **Old was too abstract**
✅ **New is specific and targeted**

---

### 4️⃣ VALUES - Complete Rewrite

#### SIGNAL OVER NOISE

**BEFORE:**
```
We filter out 99% of the news to bring
you the 1% that actually matters for
your understanding.
```

**AFTER:**
```
Hundreds of Bitcoin stories happen
every day. Most of them don't matter
to you. We read everything and tell you
the one thing that does.
```

---

#### JOURNALISTS, NOT INFLUENCERS

**BEFORE:**
```
We are journalists, not influencers.
We verify sources and don't accept
paid shills.
```

**AFTER:**
```
We don't hold Bitcoin. We don't have
affiliate deals. We verify sources and
we don't get paid to say nice things
about products.
```

---

#### THE WORLD, NOT JUST THE CHARTS

**BEFORE:**
```
Bitcoin is a global phenomenon. We cover
stories from Lagos to London, not just
Silicon Valley.
```

**AFTER:**
```
Bitcoin is happening in El Salvador, in
Lagos, in Brussels, in a garage in
Texas. We cover all of it — not just
the price.
```

---

#### WE RESPECT YOUR TIME

**BEFORE:**
```
You're busy. Five minutes. One story.
We get to the point and we stop.
```

**AFTER:**
```
We know you're busy. We get to the point
immediately. No fluff, no filler.
```

---

### 5️⃣ INTEL SQUAD - TEAM SECTION

#### BEFORE
```
Your Agentic Team
The Intel Squad

Meet the agentic team that breaks down
the Bitcoin world for you. No jargon,
no hype—just honest explanations from
people who actually understand the space.
```

#### AFTER
```
Who We Are
The Bitcoin Intrigue Family

Six different angles on the same story.
No jargon. No hype. Just honest
explanations from people who actually
get it.
```

**Team Member Bios Example:**

| | BEFORE | AFTER |
|---|---|---|
| **Uncle Ray** | Explains Bitcoin the way a smart friend does. Never hypes. Never talks down. | Explains Bitcoin the way a smart friend does. Casually. With specific details. Slightly amused by the whole thing. |
| **Grandma June** | Been through every crash. Puts today's news in perspective. | She's been through every crash, every boom, and every headline that said it was all over. She puts today in perspective. |
| **Sofia** | If she'd close the tab, it doesn't publish. She's you. | She bought Bitcoin three months ago. If she'd close the tab, it doesn't publish. She's the quality gate. |
