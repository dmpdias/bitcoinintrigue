```
**Why:** Speaks directly to outsiders, removes vagueness

### VALUES SECTION (All 4 Rewritten)
```
Signal Over Noise:
"We read everything and tell you the ONE thing that does."
→ More specific, action-oriented

Journalists, Not Influencers:
"We don't hold Bitcoin. No affiliate deals. No paid recommendations."
→ Specificity about what we DON'T do builds trust

The World, Not Just The Charts:
"Bitcoin is happening in El Salvador, Lagos, Brussels, a garage in Texas."
→ Vivid, specific, shows global research

We Respect Your Time:
"Five minutes. One story. We get to the point and we stop."
→ Creates clear contract with reader
```

### INTEL SQUAD
```
OLD TEAM: "Your Agentic Team breaks down Bitcoin world"
NEW TEAM: "The Bitcoin Intrigue Family - Six voices, one promise"

Examples of new bio tone:
• Uncle Ray: "Slightly amused by the whole thing"
• Cousin Marco: "Lagos. Next week Texas."
• Auntie Claire: "Former teacher. Allergic to jargon."
• Sofia: "She bought Bitcoin three months ago."
```
**Why:** More human, personality-driven, relatable

### TESTIMONIALS (Completely Redesigned)
```
OLD: Corporate testimonials
"As a former US Diplomat..."
"Assistant Vice President at Citi..."

NEW: Beginner testimonials (Sofia's peers)
"I bought a tiny bit on a whim and had no idea what I'd bought.
 Now I actually understand it." — Maria, 31, Teacher

"I finally stopped feeling stupid when Bitcoin came up."
 — Priya, 36, HR Manager

"It's the only newsletter I don't delete."
 — James, 28, Graphic Designer
```
**Why:** Sofia sees herself in these stories

### NEWSLETTER CTA
```

✅ "FIVE MINUTES. ONE STORY. YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET IT."

❌ "Join 45,000+ investors who start their day with clarity"
✅ "Every day, one clear explanation of what happened in Bitcoin
   — and why it matters to you."

❌ "Don't get left behind"
✅ "Your email address..."
```
**Why:** Removed fear language, focused on benefits

### FOOTER
```
OLD: "The daily 5-minute newsletter that turns Bitcoin-curious
      beginners into confident holders through simple global stories."

NEW: "Bitcoin Intrigue is a daily newsletter for people who own a
     little Bitcoin and want to actually understand it.
     No jargon. No hype. Just the story."
```
